Complicated Provenance Generation,"How to model a build and represent it in provenance, requiring new releases for unchanged source code.Some projects hesitate to adopt experimental cosign keyless signing due to external infrastructure dependencies"
Intricate Maintainance ,"Ostaclesin using  and maintaining ""slsa-github-generator"" and “slsa-github-verification” tools"
Ambigious Terminlogy,"Ambiguous, inconsistent, and sometimes undefined"
Unclear Documentation,SLSA verification installation instructions is not clear. Lack of specific documentation outlining best practices and guidelines for developing compatible tools with SLSA
Limited Attestation Verification,Needs for dedicated tooling to sign and verify artifacts during the deployment step
Two-party review Requirement ,"Costs, single maintainer projects, how do automated review (robots)/ pair programming fit into this requirement"
Unclear Relevance ,How SLSA would have protected against an attack/ aids and so on. How it's different from other frameworks
